            Scan Wi-Fi is a convenient way to connect to the Internet by scanning Wi-Fi on WeChat. Vendors and quanmin WiFi providers provide Wi-Fi services enabled by Scan Wi-Fi. The Service Terms are an integral part of Terms and Privacy. Users who use the Scan Wi-Fi service shall abide by the terms and conditions set out below:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                1. You understand and agree to: Scan Wi-Fi on WeChat is a convenient networking tool that Tencent provides for users to connect to the Internet. The Wi-Fi services enabled by Scan Wi-Fi are provided by vendors and quanmin WiFi providers. WeChat and Tencent are not Wi-Fi service providers, and assume no responsibility for the availability and security of the Wi-Fi services provided.
            </li>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                2. Scan Wi-Fi is enabled by completing Wi-Fi login authorization via your WeChat account. Doing so does not reveal any of your personal information. To ensure account security, log in with your personal WeChat account before using Scan Wi-Fi.
            </li>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                3. Scan Wi-Fi is only supported on some versions of WeChat. Confirm your WeChat version before using Scan Wi-Fi. The Scan Wi-Fi function is not available on Web WeChat or Mac WeChat.
            </li>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                4. The Wi-Fi services enabled by Scan Wi-Fi are provided by vendors and quanmin WiFi providers. Users should exercise caution when using public Wi-Fi, and follow security instructions when using Wi-Fi services. We suggest that you do not open unknown links, download unknown applications, enter your password for WeChat or QQ accounts on untrusted websites, or disclose your bank card information. For any Wi-Fi-related issues, contact the corresponding network vendor or quanmin WiFi provider.
            </li>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                5. Scan Wi-Fi is influenced by factors such as network quality, user requirements, and the policies of vendors and quanmin WiFi providers. Tencent aims to provide a smooth connection experience, but cannot guarantee that the connection services provided by vendors and quanmin WiFi providers will satisfy your requirements for bandwidth, allowed access duration, connection success rate or other service indices. Tencent is not liable if you are unable to use Scan Wi-Fi for any reason.
            </li>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                6. If you violate the law or these Service Terms, Tencent is entitled to take action without notifying you, including but not limited to, suspending or terminating the services you receive or investigating your legal liability. You may be liable to compensate for any resulting losses to Tencent or other parties.
            </li>
            <li class="mod-faq__list-item">
                7. Tencent may change the functions of Scan Wi-Fi and these Service Terms. In the event of any modifications, Tencent shall notify users of any modifications via its product and website. If you continue to use our services, you are considered to have accepted and agreed to our provisions.
            </li>
